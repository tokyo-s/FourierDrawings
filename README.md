# FourierDrawings
This is one of most interesting projects that i made so far.
It is about a math concept that is called, Fourier Series, shortly, it is saying that with the help of math and complex space, you can draw different images using rotations

Some exemples:

I was very excited when i firstly found out about this Series, and i thought, what if we could draw not only one path, but a lot of them on the same slide.
What I mean is that usually an image consist not only of one path, but of many different paths, so I thought it would be great to try copy the same image, but be created by pure math, and simple rotation.
So this are some example on what is my finall result.

There the image consist of a lot of "arrows" that draw different part of image<br>
